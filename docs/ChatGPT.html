							<span class="image left"><img src="images/pic07.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p><b>ChatGPT</b>, or Generative Pretrained Transformer, is a powerful language model developed by OpenAI. It is based on the Transformer, an architecture designed to handle sequential data in the broadest sense of the term, using the attention mechanism.</p>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>

							<p>Here's an overview of how it works:</p>	
						<p>
							<ol>
								<li><strong>Training:</strong> The process begins with training the model on a large corpus of text data from the internet. However, ChatGPT does not know specifics about which documents were in its training set and does not have the ability to access any source of information or databases. It generates responses based on patterns and information it learned during training. The model is trained to predict the next word in a sentence, given the words that came before it. This is known as unsupervised learning.</li>
								<li><strong>Fine-tuning:</strong>After this initial training, the model is then fine-tuned on a more specific dataset generated with the help of human reviewers following guidelines provided by OpenAI. This dataset contains various prompts and the appropriate responses. The reviewers review and rate possible model outputs for a range of example inputs. The model then generalizes from this reviewer feedback to respond to a wide array of user inputs.</li>
								<li><strong>Understanding and generating text:</strong>When given a piece of text as an input (like a question or a statement), ChatGPT generates a continuation of the text (like an answer or a comment). It doesn't have understanding or consciousness, rather it uses patterns it learned during training to generate this continuation.</li>
								<li><strong>Attention mechanism:</strong>The model pays different amounts of "attention" to different words in the input when generating each word in the output. For instance, when generating a response to a question, it might pay more attention to the subject of the question.</li>
								<li><strong>Probability calculation:</strong>The output is generated word by word. For each word, the model calculates a probability distribution for what the next word could be, and then selects a word based on this distribution.</li>
							</ol>

						<br>
						<p>But still, while GPT models like ChatGPT are powerful and versatile, they do have several important limitations. Here are a few:</p>
						<p>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Understanding:</strong>While GPT can generate responses that may seem contextually relevant and accurate, it doesn't truly understand the text it's generating. It doesn't understand concepts or facts about the world in the way humans do. It merely predicts the next word in a sentence based on patterns it learned during training.</li>
								<li><strong>Factuality:</strong>GPT doesn't have the ability to access or retrieve real-time or updated information. Its training only includes data up to a certain cut-off point, and it doesn't have the ability to pull in new information from the internet or any other external database. This means it may be outdated or incorrect when it comes to recent events or rapidly changing fields.</li>
								<li><strong>Ambiguity and lack of clarity:</strong>GPT can sometimes produce outputs that are vague, overly complex, or evasive, especially when asked straightforward questions. This is an artefact of the way it was trained, where it learned to mimic human-like text.</li>
								<li><strong>Inappropriate or biased content:</strong>Despite measures taken during the fine-tuning process to avoid generating harmful or inappropriate content, GPT can sometimes produce outputs that violate these guidelines. It can also unintentionally reflect biases present in the data it was trained on, potentially leading to biased or unfair outputs.</li>
								<li><strong>Reliability:</strong>GPT can sometimes make things up or guess at information when it doesn't know the answer to a question. It doesn't have a way to signal when it's unsure about an output.</li>

							</ul>
						</p>
						<p>Given these limitations, users of GPT should be cautious about taking its outputs at face value, especially when it comes to sensitive topics or important decisions. It's important to use critical thinking and verify any information it provides with other trusted sources.</p>
