        <h1>Self-awareness</h1>
        <p id="p1">Once theory of mind can be established, sometime well into 
            the future of AI, the final step will be for AI to become self-aware. 
            This kind of AI prossesses human-level consciousness and understands its
            own existence in the world, as well as the presence and emotion state of others. 
            It would be able to understand what others may need based on not just what they commumicate
            to them but how they communicate it. 

            the self-awareness in AI relies both on human researchers understanding the premise of 
            consciousness and then learning how to peplicate that so it can be built into machines.

            <span class="highlight">Will in the future human researchers find out how to make the theory of mind or even how AI to becomes self-aware?</span>
