      <h1>What is machine Learning? 04</h1>
<p id="p1">
        The so called 
        machine learning, a machine learning algorithm is fed data by a computer and uses statistical techniques to help it "learn" how to get progressively better at a task, without 
        necessarily having been specifically. ML algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values. ML consists of spervised learning(where the expected output for the input 
        is known-due to labeled data sets) and unsupervised learning(where the unexpected outputs are unknown due to the use of unlabeled data sets). 

</p>
<p>there's also Deep learning it is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through a biologically inspired neural network architecture <a href="Neutralnetwork.html">page 03</a>. The neural network contains 
number of hidden layers through which data is processed, allowing the machine to go "deep" in it's learning, making connections and weighting input for the best results.</p>

<p>the difference between ML(Machine learning) and DL(Deep learning) is that Deep learning is a form of machine learning and machine learning is a subfield of articicial intelligence.</p>
