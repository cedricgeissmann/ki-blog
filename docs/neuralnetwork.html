            Neural networks form the basis of deep learning, which is a subfield of machine learning. It is a type of machine learning algorithm that is widely used for a variety of tasks.

            We'll get to the term "machine learning" in later chapters, but generally speaking, machine learning is the art of learning inspired by the structure of the human brain, which concludes that a neural network mimics the way the human brain operates.

            Neural networks take in data, train themselves to recognize patterns in the data, and then predict the output for a new set of similar data. Neural networks are made up of layers of neurons, which are the core processing units of the network. The network is divided into the input layer, the output layer, and the hidden layers in between.

            After the input layer receives the input data, it connects with the next layer, which leads to a process called "Forward Propagation". After calculating the probabilities, an output is determined. The whole process can lead to an error, which will be corrected by "Backpropagation". This procedure trains the system to have an almost completely accurate determination of the output.

            Neural networks are already applied to some factors of our daily lives that we don't necessarily recognize. Voice assistants, forecasting (e.g., for weather or stocks), and even music composition can be based on neural networks. Neural networks can learn the structure of music to compose tunes or train the structure of the rise and fall of stocks by predicting their decrease and increase with seemingly accurate results.
