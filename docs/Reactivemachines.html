        <h1>Reactive machines</h1>
        <p>a reactive machine follows the most basic of Al principles and as its name already tells us it is capable
        of only using its intelligence to perceive and react to the "world" in front of it. A reactive machine cannot store a memory and therefore cannot
        "learn" from past experiences to inform decision making in real time. Perceiving the world means that reactive machines are designed to complete only
        a limited number of specialized duties. Intentionally narrowing a reactive machine's worldview has its benefits. However this type of AI will to be expected
        react the same way to the same situation every time.  
        </p>
        <p>For an example Deep Blue is a reactive machine which was designed as a chess-playing computer. Deep Blue was only capable of indentifying the pieces on a 
        chess board and knowing hom each moves based on the rules of chess, acknowledging each 
        piece's present position and determining what the most logical move would be
        at that moment. the computer was not pursuing future potential moves by its opponent or trying to put its own pieces in better position. Every turn was viewed 
        as its "own reality" , seperate from any other movement that was made beforehand.
