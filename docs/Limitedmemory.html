        <p id="p1">
            Limited memory AI has the abillity to store previous data and predictions when 
            gathering information and weighing potential decisions, by essentially looking
            into the past for clues on what may come next. Limited memory AI is more comprex
            and presents greater possibilities than reactive machines.
            
            Limited memory AI is created when a team ocntinuously trains a model
            in how to analyze and utilize new data or an AI environment is built so models can
            be automaticaly trained and renewed. 

            when utilizing limited memory AI in ML(machine learning)<span class="highlight"-more to 
            that on page 04></span>, six steps must be followed;

            <li>Establish training data</li>
            <li>Create the machine learning model</li>
            <li>Ensure the model can make predictions</li>
            <li>Ensure the model can receive human or environmental feedback</li>
            <li>Store human and environmental feedback as data</li>
            <li>Reiterate the steps above as a cycle</li>
