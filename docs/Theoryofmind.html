        <h1>Theory of mind</h1>
        <p>theory of mind is just theoretical. It is not yet achieved the technological and scientific
            capabilities necessary to reach this next level of AI.

            The concept is based on the pschological premise of understanding
            that other living things have thoughts and emotions that affect the
            behavior of one's self. In terms of AI machines, this would mean that 
            AI could comprehend how humans, animals, living beins and other machines feel 
            and make decisions through self-reflection and determination and the utilize 
            that information to make decisions of their own.  Essentially, machines 
            would have to be able to grasp and process the concept of "mind", the fluctautions
            of emotions in decision-making and a litany of other psychological concepts in real time,
            creating a two-way relationship between people and AI.
