        <p>Weak AI(sometimes referred to as narrow AI or specialized AI)operates within a limited context and is
            a simulation of human intelligence applied to a narrowly defined problem (like driving a car, transcribing human speech or curating content on a website).
        </p>
        <p>Weak AI is often focused on performing a single task extremely well. While these machines may seem intelligent, they operate under far more constraints and 
            limitations than even most basic human intelligence.
