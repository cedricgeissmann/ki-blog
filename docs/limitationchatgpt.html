<h1>What are the limitations of ChatGPT? 07</h1>
<p>As an Ai language model, ChatGPT is capable of performing a variety of tasks like language translation, song writing,
    answearing research questions and even gathering computer code. With its impressive abilities, ChatGPT has quickly become pupular tool for various 
    applications, from chatbots to content creations. But despite its advanced capailites, ChatGPT has certain weaknesses and challenges that can impact its 
    perfomance and accuracy. 
</p>

<h3>Lack of common sense:</h3>
<p>while ChatGPT can generate human-like responses and has acces to a large amount of infotmation, it does not posses human-level common sense -- and the model also lacks
    the backround knowledge we have. This means that ChatGPT may sometimes provide sonsensical or inaccurate responses to certain questions or 
    situations.
</p>

<h3>Lack of emotional intelligence</h3>
<p>while ChatGPT can generate responses that seem empathetic, it does not prosses true emotional intelligence. It cannot detect subtle emotional cues or respond approproately to 
    complex emotional situations.
</p>

<h3>limitations in understanding context</h3>
<p>ChatGPT has difficulty understanding context, especially sarcasm and humor. Due to the fact that it only recognize certain patterns and uses its stored data to predict a answer according to the given
    patterns. ChatGPT will fail to pick up on the intended meaning and instead provide a response that is inappripriate or  irrelevant.
</p>
<h3>potentially biased responses</h3>
<p>ChatGPT is trained on large set of text data and that data may contain biases or prejudices. This means the AI may someimes generate
    responses that are unintentionally biased or discriminatory.
</p>

<h3>Limited knowledge</h3>
<p>Although ChatGPT has acces to a large amount of information, it is not able to acces all of the knowlede that human have.</p>
<h3>Accuracy problems or grammatical issues</h3>
<p>ChatGPT's sensitive to typos, grammatical errors and misspellings is limited at the moment. 
    The model may produce responses that are technically correct but may not be entirely accurate in terms of context or relevance.-> this limitation can be particularly
    challenging when processing complex or specialized information, where accuracy and precision are crucial.
</p>
<p>and so on...</p>
<h2>What to look for when using ChatGPT</h2>
<li>
    while using ChatGPT and askin questions, it is rather more useful to not ask many question at the same time, because ChatGPT peforms best when it's given a single task or objective to     
    focus on. If you ask ChatGPT to peform multiple task or questions at once, it will strugle to priotize them, which will lead to a decrease in effectiveness and accuracy. 
</li>

<li>Do not expect when asking a complex question and given a long structured answer back, it to produce lenghtly pieces of content that follow a  particular structure.
    ChatGPT is currently best for generating shorter piececs of content like summaries, bullet points, or brief explanations.
</li>

<li>ChatGPT is not a human being and has therefore a lack of common sense. It will not understand the intended meaning behind a joke or sarcasim in general.</li>

<p id="p1">And one of the most important things, don't expect ChatGPT to be omniscient, even tho he has acces to a lot of information. Don't ask him questions about any political opinion or where emotions play a big role.
    It is not able to express itself individual, it cannot think or feel for itself.It only takes the already existing informations and talks about it in general. After all it is just a machine and it is not able to 
    feel/think or "learn" to feel/think at the moment and hopefully also for the future.
