							<p><b>Artificial Intelligence</b> (AI) is a dynamic branch of computer science that aims to create mechanisms enabling computers and digital devices to exhibit intelligent behavior. AI systems, ranging from narrow (weak) AI to general (strong) AI, learn from their experiences and make decisions autonomously, which greatly assists humans in various daily tasks.</p>
							<p><b>Weak AI or narrow AI</b> is specialized to operate within a specific context. It simulates human intelligence applied to a narrowly defined problem like driving a car, speech recognition, or content curation. This AI category includes technologies like voice assistants (Siri, Alexa), recommendation systems, and image recognition software.</p>
							<p>On the contrary, <b>strong AI, also known as Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)</b>, aims to solve problems that it has not been explicitly trained for, just like humans. This type of AI aspires to replicate human-level intelligence across a vast array of tasks. Although the creation of AGI is the ultimate goal for many AI researchers, as of now, AGI doesn't exist, and its development has faced several challenges. <br>
							<br>	
							<span class="image right"><img src="images/pic06.jpg"/></p>
							
							<p>AI employs various techniques like <b>machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision</b> to learn patterns, analyze data, make predictions, and even exhibit behavior that mimics human judgment and reasoning. AI works by combining large datasets with intuitive processing algorithms to learn behavior patterns within the dataset.</p>
							<p>Numerous sectors have been profoundly impacted by AI, ranging from advanced web search engines to self-driving cars, recommendation systems, and strategic game systems. Additionally, AI has enabled businesses, like HubSpot, to optimize their workflows, closely monitor team performance, and provide crucial data-driven insights.</p>
							<p>However, alongside the advancements, the journey of AI has experienced cycles of optimism and disappointment. The development of AI has also raised <b>philosophical and ethical issues</b> concerning the creation of artificial beings with human-like intelligence. Economists have pointed out the risks of job redundancies due to AI, emphasizing the need for robust social policies.</p>

							<h1 class="major">How does it function?</h1>
							<p>AI, or artificial intelligence, functions by using algorithms and computational models to mimic human-like intelligence in machines. Here's a simplified breakdown of how it works:</p>
							<p>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> AI systems need large amounts of data to learn and make predictions. This data could come from various sources, such as text documents, images, audio files, or user behavior logs.</li>
								<li><strong>Preprocessing:</strong> Raw data is often messy and inconsistent. Before an AI system can learn from it, the data needs to be preprocessed. This step may involve removing errors, handling missing data, normalizing numerical values, or converting text to a format that the AI can understand.</li>
								<li><strong>Modeling:</strong> Depending on the task, an appropriate AI model is chosen. This could be a machine learning model, like a decision tree or a support vector machine, or a neural network model, which is used in deep learning. The model describes how the AI system should process the data.</li>
								<li><strong>Training:</strong> The AI system learns from the data by adjusting its internal parameters to minimize the difference between its predictions and the actual outcomes. This process is often guided by an optimization algorithm, like gradient descent.</li>
								<li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> After the model is trained, it's evaluated on a separate set of data that it hasn't seen before. This step is crucial to ensure that the AI system is capable of generalizing its knowledge to new data.</li>
								<li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Once the AI system is performing satisfactorily, it can be deployed in the real world, where it can make predictions or decisions based on new data.</li>
								<li><strong>Learning and Updating:</strong> Post-deployment, the AI continues to learn and adapt based on new data and feedback it receives. This allows the AI to improve over time and adjust to changing conditions.</li>
							</ul>
							</p>
							<p>The input data also plays a vital role in the performance and behavior of an AI system. Here are several ways in which the input data can influence AI:</p>
    							<ul>
       								<li><strong>Learning and Prediction:</strong> AI models learn from input data by identifying patterns, correlations, or relationships within it. The quality of learning and subsequent predictions or decisions made by the AI model heavily depends on the quality and quantity of this input data.</li>
        							<li><strong>Bias:</strong> If the input data is biased, the AI system's output will likely also be biased. For example, if an AI model trained on data from a specific population group is used to make predictions about a different group, the model may produce biased or inaccurate results.</li>
        							<li><strong>Overfitting and Underfitting:</strong> If an AI model is trained on too little data (underfitting), it may not capture the underlying patterns effectively, leading to poor performance on unseen data. Conversely, if the model is trained on an overly complex dataset or for too long (overfitting), it may "memorize" the training data and perform poorly on new, unseen data.</li>
        							<li><strong>Robustness:</strong> The quality of input data can also impact the robustness of an AI system. For example, if an AI system trained mainly on high-quality, clean data encounters messy or erroneous data in real-world scenarios, its performance may decline.</li>
        							<li><strong>Data Diversity:</strong> The diversity of input data can affect the generalizability of an AI system. For instance, if a self-driving car AI is trained only on data collected in clear weather conditions, it might perform poorly in rain or snow. To work well in various scenarios, the model should be trained on diverse and representative data.</li>
    							</ul>
    						<p>In summary, the input data for AI systems should be accurate, unbiased, diverse, representative, and large enough to ensure optimal learning, robustness, and performance of the models.</p>

							<h1 class="major">How does a Neural Network function?</h1>
							<p><b>Neural networks</b>, also known as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), are algorithms used in <b>machine learning and artificial intelligence</b>. Inspired by the human brain's functionality, they form the foundation for AI. A typical neural network consists of three primary layers - the Input Layer, Hidden Layer, and the Output Layer. These networks help AI interpret various types of data such as images, texts, sounds, etc. </p>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/diagram.svg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>The <b>Input Layer</b> is responsible for providing essential information to the neural network. Neurons in this layer weight the data before forwarding it to the Hidden Layer. It consists of a single level.</p>
							<p>The <b>Hidden Layer</b>, aptly named for its lack of direct visibility, consists of potentially multiple layers that function to reconfigure the data imported from the Input Layer. In these layers, data is continually reassessed in terms of weight as it progresses from one neuron to another. Despite the fact that the data within the Input and Output Layers are transparent and observable, the information within the Hidden Layer remains concealed, passing through a succession of recalibrations until it is ultimately dispatched to the Output Layer.</p>
							<p>Composed of a single layer like the Input Layer, the <b>Output Layer</b> forms the terminal point of a neural network, connecting directly to the final layer of the Hidden Layer. It is here that the Output Neurons generate the conclusive data or results.</p>
							<p>Neural networks work like the human brain. They are made up of parts called <b>nodes or artificial neurons</b>, spread across different layers. Each node takes in information, processes it, and gives out a result.</p>
							<p>When a problem that needs a decision comes up, lots of data is given to the nodes in the Input Layer of an AI system. Each node looks at a different type of data and sends it to all nodes in the first Hidden Layer. In the hidden layers, each node handles this data in different ways. Each node has some specific conditions to meet, and if these conditions aren't met, the node doesn't send any signal to the next layer. Before a node can check if its conditions are met, it needs to do some math using a function called an activation function.</p>
							<p>Each piece of information that comes in is put into this function. Important to note is that every connection between two nodes has a specific 'weight', which shows how important the information is. The weights related to specific connections are worked out with the incoming data, giving the value to be put into a node's activation function. There is also an extra part called the 'bias' that changes the value of the incoming data a bit more.</p>
							<p>After the function is worked out, the node checks if its conditions have been met. If yes, it sends a signal to the next layer. If a node doesn't get a signal from a certain node, it's still useful because it shows that certain conditions weren't met.</p>
							<br>
							<br>
							<p>For this blog we have a digit recognition which can be used to try how the output of neural network works. It can be found <a href="digits.html"><i>here</i></a>.</p>
							<p>Think about when the system is trying to recognize a written digit. Let's imagine a simple system with two hidden layers. This system is given the necessary data for a written digit at the Input Layer. At the first Hidden Layer, certain details are already figured out. For example, a node might need a circle in the top half of the digit. After working out the incoming data and the weights of their connections, it might send a signal to the second Hidden Layer, depending on the result.</p>
							<p>In theory, the second Hidden Layer could have a node for each possible written digit. Each of these nodes would need that the shown digit matches its assigned digit. Let's say the digit is 'nine'. The node for this digit would need to get signals from the node in the last layer that checks for a circle in the top half, and another node that checks for a curve on the left in the bottom half. If it gets these signals and no other confusing signals, the node tells the Output Layer. This layer, after getting the information, decides that the written digit is indeed a 'nine'.</p>

							<h2>Types of Machine Learning</h2>
								<ul>
								<li>
									<h3>Supervised Learning</h3>
									<p>Here, the computer is trained with known data. For example, if we want to teach the computer to identify cats or dogs in pictures, we use pictures that are already labeled as 'cat' or 'dog'.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>Unsupervised Learning</h3>
									<p>This method involves training the computer with unknown data. The goal is to find patterns in the data. For example, to understand how customers behave when they buy things.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>Reinforcement Learning</h3>
									<p>In this type, the computer learns by trial and error. It is given rewards for good actions and penalties for bad ones. Over time, it learns to make better decisions.</p>
								</li>
							</ul>
