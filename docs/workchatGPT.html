<h1>ChatGPT 06</h1>
<h3>what is ChatGPT?</h3>
<p>ChatGPT is AI trained to assist with a variety of tasks, more specifically it is 
a language model AI designed to produce human-like text conservations. </p>

<h3>how does it work?</h3>
<p id="p2">
    ChatGPT, like the name already tells it, consists of GPT(<span class="highlight1">Generative</span> <span class="highlight2">pre-trained</span> <span class="highlight3">transformer</span>), a type of
    AI language model. 
</p>
    <li>
        <span class="highlight1">Generative</span> represents the ability to generate natural human language texts
    </li>
        
    <li>
    The <span class="highlight2">pre-trained</span>represents the fact that the model has already been trained on some finite dataset, much like you'd read a book or maybe
    several books before being asked question about it 
    </li>
    
    <li>
 the <span class="highlight3">transformer </span> represents the underlying machine-learning architecture that powers GPT.
    </li>
    <p>ChatGPT itself was not trained from the ground up. Instead it's a fine-tuned version of GPT-3.5, which itself is a fine-tuned version of GPT-3.
        GPT-3 model was trained with a massive amount of data collected from the internet. Take Wikipedia, Twitter and Reddit for an example, those are all 
        platforms within the internet, where mostly human texts and also a lot of data can be found by AI but not only in those platforms but from all corners
        of the internet can AI find tons of informations/data. But how is the ChatGPT able to answer questions? Well, the "magic" behind it all ties neatly into its training.

        After covering every inch of your Physics 101 textbook, there's good chance you'll be able to answer any questions from it that's thrown at you. Why? Because
        you've read it and you've learned it. It's the same thing with ChatGPT--it learns. And as humans, the AI can with enough training, solve <span class="highlight4">almost</span> any problem.

        While a human can manage to read hundreds of books within their lifetime, ChatGPT or GPT has already consumed(pre-trained) a huge chunk of the interent. If then a specific question is asked, the GPT
        then recognize patterns and would then use its "knowledge" of those patterns to "predict" the answer.
        
        <p>Predict. The word predict plays a huge role here. Because ChatGPT doesen't answer questions the same way we do as humans. If a human is faced with a question, the human would be able to answer the question
            due to a fact. However ChatGPT doesen't answer questions with 100% certainly. Instead it tries to predict the right answer given to patterns of the question and then uses its consumed data set of the patterns. </p>
