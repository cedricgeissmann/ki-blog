    <h1>How does AI work? 02</h1>
    
      <p id="p4">
        There are as mentioned many different types of AI(previous page(01)).</p><p>

        If we take a customer service
        chatbot, for example. After we type a question the chatbot uses an algorithm - or also known as 
        a set of rules to recognize keyworks and identify what kind of help you need. The chatbot does have - is 
        a machine learning model, meaning it is a constantly new learning intelligent like us humans. But there are different ways how the AI "learns". The so called 
        machine learning, a machine learning algorithm is fed data by a computer and uses statistical techniques to help it "learn" how to get progressively better at a task, without 
        necessarily having been specifically. ML algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values. ML consists of spervised learning(where the expected output for the input 
        is known-due to labeled data sets) and unsupervised learning(where the unexpected outputs are unknown due to the use of unlabeled data sets). 
        programmed for that task.  
        based on the already existing and new information is has, then generates an
        approproate response. The meaning behind the "new learning" Model is that the chatbot in this exampe, improves over time 
        as it interacts with new customes and receives therefore more information - the chatbot is constantly learning.
