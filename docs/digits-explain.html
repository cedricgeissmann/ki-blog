        <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>
    Digit learning and recognition is a part of machine learning which refers to identifying a certain, in this case, handwritten digit (from 0-9). It contains the following steps:
    </p>
    <p>
    1.) Dataset: The first step is to gather the dataset of handwritten digits, which consists of those digits and their corresponding labels (0-9)
    </p>
    <p>
    2.) Differentiate digits: In the second step the system learns to differentiates digits, often based on its pixel intensity, the placement of pixels, edges and contours. 
    </p>
    <p>
    3.) Training: During training the model learns to use its knowledge of differentiation and the dataset to match each written number to the corresponding digit.
    </p>
    <p>
    4.) Evaluation: The prediction of the model are compared to ground truth labels to measure its accuracy.
    If there are errors while predicting or a low accuracy, then the model will refine itself and continue training.

            <h2>Usage</h2>
        <p>
        This process has a wide variety of usage:
        </p>
        <p>
        <li>Postal system: Postal systems use this process to recognize mails and can sort them a lot quicker without humankind needing to seperatly sort them. </li>
        </p>

        <p>
            <li>Finance and Banking: Digit recognition is utilized in banking and finance for tasks such as recognizing handwritten checks and reading account numbers on checks or deposit slips.  </li>
        </p>

        <p>
            <li>Education: Digit recognition technology can be used in educational settings to assess students' handwritten responses to numerical questions or quizzes. It allows for automated grading and provides instant feedback to students.</li>

                <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p>
            Problem, which may occur within digit recognition may be:
            </p>
            <p>
            <li>Variety of handwriting: Because everyone has different handwriting styles, the model may not be able to recognize certain handwritings. Especially when people write numbers in another way. Eg. some people write the number 1 consisting of one line while others write it with an additional small line towards the left. </li>
            </p>

            <p>
            <li>Overlapping: Sometimes digits may overlap, leading to the system being confused about this ambiguous case and therefore giving an inaccurate result.</li>
            </p>

            <p>
            <li>Limited Training Data: If there is a limit of data, the system won't have enough knowledge and will have a hardtime to train its accuracy.</li>
            </p>
