    <h3 id="1">What is AI?</h3>


    <section>
      <p>
        AI is the abbreviation for artificial intelligence. The word artificial intelligence is a compound word <br>
         that consist of the word artificial deriving from Latin  artificiālis meaning “skill”, combined with the <br>
          Proto-Italic word inter-legere meaning to choose from something. But now that we have covered the  <br>
          origin of the word let’s look at what exactly AI even is.
      </p>
    </section>



    <section>
      <p>
        Artificial intelligence is often just referred to as AI, which is simply the abbreviation for artificial <br> 
        intelligence. When talking about AI we refer to a rather wide-ranging branch of computer science <br>
         dealing with the development of intelligence machines that are able to perform tasks that under <br>
         normal circumstances would require the Intelligence of a human being. This means they can  <br>
         perform many functions that normal computers are not able to perform on their own, since they <br>
         lack intelligence and must be led or guided by a human. This is not necessary with AI since it can <br>
         carry out Functions such as playing games, recognizing patterns, such as numbers, generating texts <br>
         or even images imitating certain artists, without requiring the involvement of a human being. These <br>
         machines are called AI since they seem to have an intelligence that allows them to execute functions <br>
         that require intelligence on their own. The fact that this is not fully the case yet will be covered in <br>
          the chapter Strong AI vs Weak AI.<br>
      </p>
    </section>



    <section>
      <p>
        A major characteristic of AI is that it learns by processing massive amounts of data. This process is <br>
        often supervised by humans, but in certain cases also autonomic, meaning the AI learns on its own. <br>
        This feature is especially important since it is a major advantage compared to other computers.<br>
      </p>
    </section>

    <h3 id="2">Strong AI Vs Weak AI</h3>



    <section>
      <p>
        Since the term intelligence is rather difficult to define and the level of intelligence of certain AI <br>
        massively varies, AI is often categorized into so called strong and weak AI. But what exactly is <br>
        the difference between those two?  <br>
      </p>
    </section>



    <section>
      <p>
        Strong AI or artificial general intelligence as it is often referred to has cognitive abilities that are <br>
        equivalent or even superior to the ones of an average human brain. This makes them, at least in <br>
        theory, equal, if not more intelligent than humans. This high level of intelligence or rather cognitive <br>
        abilities allow strong AI to carry out functions and solve problems that it has not been trained for.<br>
        This is also a main factor that is used to define intelligence, the ability to solve new or unknown <br>
        problems. However, including this in the definition of intelligence, none of the already existing AI <br>
        would be considered intelligent. The kind of AI that fulfills this definition is only the one we see in <br>
        science fiction movies such as Stars Wars or Star Trek. A concrete example of an AI in a science fiction <br>
        movie would be “The Doctor” from Star Trek: “Voyager”, which portrays an AI doctor in form of a  <br>
        hologram. However, this type of AI does not actually exist yet. Therefor when applying those <br>
        standards to existing AI, none of them would be considered a strong AI, but rather a weak AI. <br>
      </p>
    </section>



    <section>
      <p>
        In contrast to strong AI, Weak AI exists already and has become a important part of our daily life, <br> 
        even though it is strongly limited. Also, it is not actually intelligent but rather simulates human <br>
        intelligence. It can therefore only be used to fulfill a small range of functions. An example of <br>
        Weak AI would be Siri or Alexa.<br>
      </p>

    <h3 id="3">How does AI work?</h3>


    <section>
      <p>
        AI consists of a neural network consisting of neurons so called nodes that are arranged in layers.<br>
        There are generally three different types of layers: an Input Layer, Hidden Layers, and an Output Layer.<br>
        When data is fed intothe systems it starts at the Input Layer. There each node is connected to all the nodes<br>
        in the following Hidden Layer. However, the different connections between the nodes of the two different<br>
        layers have different weights. The weight of a connection determines the importance of it. Therefore,<br>
        even though all nodes of the first Hidden Layer receive the sameinformation / data, the weight of <br>
        the information that arrives is different in any node. To prevent an overflow of semi-important <br>
        information each of the nodes in the Hidden Layer performs an activation function. This function <br>
        sets a hurdle,meaning that the function controls the weight of the gathered information and if <br>
        the sum of the weight of all arriving information is too low it is not passed on.<br>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>
        Also, each and every node has a different so-called feature that it focuses on. Those features are not <br>
        given, instead they develop over time. The node is then in the information it is given looking for that <br>
        feature. Taking the number recognition system that we tested with the number 9 as an example: One node <br>
        in the Hidden Layer might focus on the circle on top, whereas a neighboring node might focus on the <br>
        stroke downwards. Those nodes are then only activated when the feature they focus on is present.<br>
      </p>
    </section>


    <section>
      <p>
      Dependent on the activation function used it might have a set value or border. In this case it only <br>
      activates if the weight of information is above a limit, otherwise the function can also be linear.In the<br>
      End, after the data was passed on from the Input Layer to the Hidden Layers it is eventually passed onto the<br>
      Output Layer. In the Output Layer all the information is gathered and put together into one single output.<br>
      </p>
    </section>

    <h3 id="4">How does AI learn?</h3>

    <section>
      <p>
        In order to learn the AI is trained. In some cases, this training in supervised in others it is not <br>
        supervised by humans. This creates the risk of the AI learning offensive, racist or sexist language if<br>
        it’s learning is based on data from the Internet.But how exactly does it work? <br>
      </p>
    </section>



    <section>
      <p>
        In the beginning the weights of the connections between the nodes are assigned randomly. Then the data <br>
        passes through the entire system and an output is created. In a training situation the AI is then given a<br>
        reference. It is showed what the output is supposed to look like. The AI then compares its output to the<br>
        reference and adjusts the weights of the connections. The data is then fed into the system again and the<br>
        output again compared to a reference. This process is repeated over and over again. The rate at which <br>
        the AI adjusts its weights is called the learning rate. This learning rate is usually set somewhere <br>
        above 0 and below 1. Even though a high rate might seem optimal it is not. Having a learning rate of<br>
        1 would mean that the weight is perfectly adjusted to the reference. This would lead to the AI only <br>
        being trained to the last data that was given as a reference. In order to work correctly the <br>
        adjustments, have to be made slowly and gradually. The picture below illustrates the <br> 
        different weights those connections between nodes can have.<br>
      </p>
    </section>

    <img src="https://computerhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Neural_network_example.png" alt="Weight of connections">


    <section>
      <p>
        Really interesting is AI however as soon as it has been trained to different data sets. This allows it<br>
        to analyze the given data set and to find patterns and regularities. Based on those patterns the AI then<br>
        adjusts and chooses an optimal distribution of the weight, so that each connection can be assigned to the<br>
        most optimal weight according to the data set given. Based on the data set the AI can then predict the<br>
        optimal weight distribution.<br>
      </p>
    </section>

    <h3 id="5">What influence does data have on AI?</h3>

    <section>
      <p>
        The influence of data on AI is crucial. Data is the basis for the learning process of AI. Huge amounts of <br>
        data must be fed into an AI to  properly train it. Also, the quality and diversity of the provided data have<br>
        a major impact on the performance and accuracy of AI since AI  relies on data to train its algorithm. <br>
        Therefor AI is often supervised when learning because some data that the AI might find on the <br>
        internet is potentially harmful, racist, exist or simply of bad quality, sometimes even <br>
        containing false information. This shows us that data is not only “the life blood” of AI,<br>
        but also largely responsible for its quality and efficiency.<br>
      </p>

    <h3 id="6">How does ChatGPT work?</h3>

    <section>
      <p>
        ChatGPT is an AI programmed by OpenAI. ChatGPT can hold conversations and generate text, however it <br>
        knowledge of recent events is strongly limited and it cannot yet process input in form of pictures or <br>
        diagrams. ChatGPT attempts to understand your question or input and will then generate a string of words<br>
        as an output that predicts will answer your question best. It predicts those answers based on the data<br>
        it has been trained on. ChatGPT was also trained through a enormous amount of data. Roughly 5 billion<br>
        tokens to be exact. Tokens sequences of characters that frequently occur in texts. Whereas the AI <br>
        understands the statistical relationship between the tokens it is not aware of their meaning. Also,<br>
        Tokens are not necessarily words but simply parts of words. Since ChatGPT is not aware of the <br>
        meaning of the words it is generating it first generates a random sequence of tokens. Then it <br>
        compares those tokens with the input it was given and adjusts. This process is repeated <br>
        several times in the hope of eventually creating an output that matches the given input<br>
        and answers the question.<br>
      </p>
    </section>


    <h3 id="7">What are the limitations of ChatGPT & what to look out for?</h3>


    <section>
      <p>
        When working with AI such as ChatGPT it is important to be aware of the limitations of the<br>
        AI used, as well as potential risks when using it. Since as with every other AI, also ChatGPT<br>
        has its limitations. Therefore, here are some factors and bullet points to look for when using it.<br>
      </p>
    </section>



   
    <section>
      <p>
        The most prominent issue with ChatGPT is probably that ChatGPT uses the Internet as a source and can<br>
        therefore not only spread fake news, but also develop a racist or sexist vocabulary. Another problem<br>
        is that ChatGPT cannot provide the sources used to generate these texts, making it difficult to prove<br>
        that the AI is trained where certain knowledge comes from. This is the reason why it should not be used<br>
        for Projects that require the listing of sources.  Also, some cases have been reported where ChatGPT <br>
        has integrated fake news or invented facts, even about certain books or stories. This shows us that<br>
        checking the information given by ChatGPT is a must, to use it as a reliable source. Further it is<br>
        remarkable that even the website itself talks about limitations e.g.mentions the generation of <br>
        incorrect information that can occur. <br>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>
        A different common issue that is addressed as well is that I may produce harmful content or instruction <br>
        and that it has a limited knowledge of events after 2021. It is therefore advisable to only use ChatGPT<br>
        as a tool and to back up your data when using it.  Also, ChatGPT shouldn’t be doing important work <br>
        without being supervised by a human being that can correct mistakes or back up certain facts. <br>
        As a matter of facts ChatGPT should not be working for you, but with you, supporting your work<br>
        as a tool and not replacing you. <br>
      </p>
