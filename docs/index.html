      <h3>What is AI?</h3>
      
      The word AI or in German known as KI stands for "Artificial Intelligence" respectively "Künstliche Intelligenz"
      AI refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence, for example understanding natural language, recognizing objects, making decisions, and learning from experience.
      AI is a field of computer science that became established in the 1950s. It was described at the time as a new science which would systematically study the phenomenon of "intelligence".This goal was to be pursued by using computers to simulate intelligent processes. 
      The central assumption of AI was that the logical operations of computers could be structured to imitate human thought processes, which certaintly is now possible (e.g OpenAI) and available for everyone with access of internet.
      Because the workings of a computer are understood while those of the human mind are not fully, AI researchers hoped in this way to reach a scientific understanding of the phenomenon of "intelligence"
      The goal of AI is to provide software that can reason on input and explain on output. AI will provide human-like interactions with software and offer decision support for specific tasks. 
      The beauty of AI is, that you have the ability to programm computers with judgement and reasoning, meaning that, by showing an AI system an image or an audio, it will understand what is beeing said.

      <h3>How does AI work?</h3>

      As mentioned before, AI aims to develop intelligent systems that can analyze and process large amounts of data, learn from experience, and make decisions.
      //But how can this kind human thinking and problem solving be taught to AI?//

      AI is a broad field of study that includes many methods, *technologies*, aswell as major subfields like machine learning, deep learning and a neural network (which will be covered in the following questions).
      *Technologies*, which support AI, like Graphical processing units, APIs & application programming interfaces and Advanced algorithms enable AI to work faster and more efficient.
      Generally speaking, AI works with data by using algorithms and statistical models to analyze and learn from large amounts of data this process is divided into steps such as collecting, preprocessing and training data, model evaluation and lastly model developement.
      Of course AI systems can differ in their approach, techniques, and underlying technologies, and the choice of which approach to use depends on the specific task and the nature of the data being analyzed.

      <h4>How does a neural network work?</h4>
      
      Neural network form the base of deep learning, which is a subfield of machine learning. 
      We'll get to the term "machine learning" in later chapters, but generally speaking, machine learning is the art of learning inspired by the structure of the human brain,
      which concludes that a neural network mimics the way human brain operates.
      Neural networks take in data, train themselves to recognize the patterns in the data and then predict the output for a new set of similar data. 
      A Neural networks are made up of layers of neurons, which are the core processing unit of the network.
      The network is divided into the input layer, the output layer and the hidden layers in between. 
      //IMAGE FOR VISUALIZATION//
      After the input layer receives the input data, it connects with the next layer, this leads to  a process called *"Forward Propagation"*//ÖBBIS SÄGE??, after calculating the 
      probabilities, an output is determined. The whole process can lead to an error, wihich will be corrected by "Backpropagation". This procedure trains the system to have a almost completely accurate determination of the output.

      Neural network is already applied to some factors of our daily lives, that we don't necessairly recognize. 
      Voice assistants, Forecasting (e.g for weather or stocks) but also music composition can be based on neural networks.
      Neural networks can learn the structure of music to compose tunes or train the structure of the fall and rise of stocks by predicting it's decrease and increase seemingly accurate.
