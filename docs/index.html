      <h3>What is AI?</h3>
      
      The word AI or in German known as KI stands for "Artificial Intelligence" respectively "KÃ¼nstliche Intelligenz"
      AI refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence, for example understanding natural language, recognizing objects, making decisions, and learning from experience.
      AI is a field of computer science that became established in the 1950s. It was described at the time as a new science which would systematically study the phenomenon of "intelligence".This goal was to be pursued by using computers to simulate intelligent processes. 
      The central assumption of AI was that the logical operations of computers could be structured to imitate human thought processes, which certaintly is now possible (e.g OpenAI) and available for everyone with access of internet.
      Because the workings of a computer are understood while those of the human mind are not fully, AI researchers hoped in this way to reach a scientific understanding of the phenomenon of "intelligence"
      The goal of AI is to provide software that can reason on input and explain on output. AI will provide human-like interactions with software and offer decision support for specific tasks. 
      The beauty of AI is, that you have the ability to programm computers with judgement and reasoning, meaning that, by showing an AI system an image or an audio, it will understand what is beeing said.
      With the underlying we will be covering questions regarding the system making AI function, but also discuss possible ethical problems.
      
      //DOES AI HAVE INTRAPERSONAL INTELLIGENCE?//
      
      <h3>How does AI work?</h3>

      As mentioned before, AI aims to develop intelligent systems that can analyze and process large amounts of data, learn from experience, and make decisions.
      //But how can this kind human thinking and problem solving be taught to AI?//

      AI is a broad field of study that includes many methods, *technologies*, aswell as major subfields like machine learning, deep learning and a neural network (which will be covered in the following questions).
      *Technologies*, which support AI, like Graphical processing units, APIs & application programming interfaces and Advanced algorithms enable AI to work faster and more efficient.
      Generally speaking, AI works with data by using algorithms and statistical models to analyze and learn from large amounts of data this process is divided into steps such as collecting, preprocessing and training data, model evaluation and lastly model developement.
      Of course AI systems can differ in their approach, techniques, and underlying technologies, and the choice of which approach to use depends on the specific task and the nature of the data being analyzed.

      <h4>What is machine learning?</h4>
      Machine learning is directly connected to neural networks.
      Like touched on above, Machine learning is a branch of AI and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.

      <h4>What is the difference between machine learning, deep learning and neural networks?</h4>
      The three terms are often used interchangeably, but still there are differences that differ the three fields from eachother.

     <h4>What influence does data have on an AI?</h4>
    

      <h4>How does ChatGPT work?</h4>
      According to ChatGPT itself, ChatGPT is a Chatbot based on AI. With the help of algorithms like language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) it understand and is able to respond to an input of the user.
      Since it has been trained with a lot of text data, ChatGPT recognizes patterns, which allows it to give responses which are relevant to the user's input.
      The in depth working of ChatGPT is as followed:
      1.) INPUT PROCESSING: After a user typed a text, ChatGPT uses NLP algorithms to process the input from the user and extract relevant information. 
      While doing so ChatGPT breaks the input made up of long sentences into individual words (tokenization) and indentifies the parts of speech aswell as named entities in the input (part-of-speech tagging and entitiy-recognition), by this it can understand the structure of the text.

      2.) CONTEXTUAL UNDERSTANDING: To analyze the input of the user ChatGPT uses machine learning algorithms which involves identifying the user's intent and relevant context such as hthe previous interactions. 

      3.) RESPONSE GENERATION: Based on the input, ChatGPT generates a response by using its pre-trained models to generate a text grammaticaly correct. 

      4.) OUTPUT DELIVERY: After generating a response, ChatGPT delivers it the the user  through the chat interface, and the process repeats.



      <h4>What are the limitations of ChatGPT and what should one look out for when using it?</h4>
      Even tho it can seem like, ChatGPT has every answer to our questions, there are limitations of the chatbot we should be aware of.
      
      1.) LACK OF COMMON SENSE: Since ChatGPT is not a human, it lacks common sense knowledge like humans do which means that it could generate irrelevant and nonsensial responses. Since it is not human, it does not have emotional intelligence like we do.
          Common sense is practical knowledge and understanding shared by most people in a society or culture. It includes a wide range of intuitive knowledge, like knowing that water is wet and fire is hot. This common sense knowledge is in most cases aquired through life experiences and observation.

      2.) INCORRECT ANSWERS: Because ChatGPT is constantly evolving and learning, it will make mistakes especially when the user asks a complex questions.
      Instead of acknowledging that it does not know the answer to something, ChatGPT will form a "plausible-sounding" answer. 

      3.) BIASED ANSWERS: Since ChatGPT is trained with information mostly from the internet (which are not publicly disclosed), it could reflect possible biases, especially if a person is trying to get misinformation on purpose.
      Studies which analylzed billions of words on the internet has shown that certain groups, such as Afro-Americans, people with disabilities or women, are more likely to be associated with negative and stereotypical words than others. 
      ChatGPT was also accused of being biased against conservatives, which according to the "New York Post" shows liberal bias by appearing more negative of hateful comments made about conservatives than exact comments made by liberals.
      (https://nypost.com/2023/03/14/chatgpts-bias-allows-hate-speech-toward-gop-men-report/)
      (https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-630-billion-word-internet-analysis-shows-people-is-interpreted-as-men/)


      After all it is important to double-check the accuracy and relevance of ChatGPT's responses. 
      Therefore it is recommended to combine ChatGPT with other tools while doing some sort of research. 

      <h4>To what extend can AI be benifitial/harmful for humanity?</h4>

      In the future AI will be more and more crucial for society. It has the potential to bring significant benefits to humanity across various domains.
      1.) HEALTH CARE: It already made large progress in the domain of health care and medicine. Now doctors / surgeons have been able to recive the results to prove cancerous cells within few hours, instead of 4-5  weeks, through AI.
      This type of  diagnosis will not be only faster but also reduce errors.
      This enables patients to get a faster diagnosis and treatment. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bcgms_xkpSg&t=278s)
      
      2.) FINANCE AND ECONOMY: Within economy AI will be available 24/7 to answer questions of costumers, which avoids long waiting. 
      It can analyze vast amounts of financial data to detect fraud, identify investment opportunities, and provide personalized financial advice.
      This would reduce the work of human and let human concentrate on more efficient tasks.

      3.) DAILY LIFE: Other tasks that AI replaces and would simplify our worklife: 
          <li>LANGUAGE TRANSLATION: AI-powered translation tools can quickly and accurately translate text or speech between different languages.</li>
          <li>QUALITY CONTROL: AI can monitor manufacturing processes and detect defects or in real-time.</li>
          <li>IMAGE AND VIDEO ANALYSIS: AI algorithms can analyze and categorize vast amounts of visual data, making it easier to organize and search through image and video collections.</li>
