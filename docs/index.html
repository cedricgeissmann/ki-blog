          <h2>What is AI?</h2>
          <p>
            Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science, but nevertheless an interdisciplinary domain that combines 
            many fields besides computer science, as for example mathematics, statistics and psychology. It involves the development
            and transposition of intelligent machines able to carry out tasks that typically require human intelligence. 
            Therefore, it should represent a model of the human mind that has problem-solving and decision-making capabilities and 
            is therefore able to recognize models and interpret language.
            </p> <p> At its core, AI aims to create machines that can reason, learn, and adapt in ways similar to humans. These intelligent 
            systems are designed to process large amounts of data, make informed decisions, and even interact with humans in a natural 
            and human-like manner.
            They are given certain datasets to learn with, and based on those they make choices, but humans usually supervise what 
            exactly they are learning. Some things would be bad or even dangerous for them to know or understand, so therefore this kind 
            of learning is denied.
            One can find AI in a lot of different forms, among the most popular are inventions such as self-driving cars, Siri, 
            Alexa or Chat GPT.
            <p> (More detailed informations about Chat GPT, will be discussed here: <a href="#section6">How does chat GPT work?</a>)</p>

          <p>
            Algorithms and data are used to enable AI to mimic human behavior and mind. The AI needs to make intelligent and educated decisions, 
            to make sure it does so, a massive amount of data is needed. This can be structured, as well as unstructured information.
            Unstructured information includes text, photos or videos. The quality and variety of the data are essential for building powerful AI models. 
            The system behind AI is discussed in <a href="#section3">How does a neural network work?</a> and the learning process in  <a href="#section4">What is machine learning?</a>

          <h2>How does a neural network work?</h2>
          <p>
            A neural network is a computational model based on how the human brain works and is organized. 
            It is an essential part of many machine learning algorithms. 
            Neural networks are needed for:
            <p>- identifying patterns </p>
            <p>- learning from data</p>
            <p>- making predictions or judgments</p>
           <p> It consists of a series of algorithms, inspired by the systems of neurons of the human brain and commonly looks something like this:</p>

            <p><img id="neuralnetworkpic1" src="https://www.hotelmize.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/How-does-a-neural-network-works.png" alt="Neural Network"
            style="height: 300px;">
</p>
<p>One of these points represents a so called “node” which imitates a neuron (A type of cell that receives and sends messages
   from the body to the brain and vive versa). 
  A node is a mathematical function that collects and 
  classifies information according to specific architectures. The image above visualizes these mathematical functions to make 
  them more understandable. </p>
  <p>Those nodes are interconnected in different layers, called the “Input Layer”, the “Hidden Layers” and the “Output Layer”. In each 
  layer, all nodes are connected with all nodes in the previous as well as in the following layer.
  Every neural network starts with the input layer, in which all nodes are receiving the data later used to make a decision. 
  There, each node receives different data, which they send to all nodes in the first hidden layer. The decision making takes place 
  in the hidden layers, since every node in every hidden layer has certain requirements, without which they won’t send a signal to the 
  nodes on the next layer. </p>
  <p>When the signals are sent from the input layer to the first hidden layer, each connection has a parameter called “weight”. 
  The weights are settled in the learning process of machine learning, which is explained here: <a href="#section4">What is machine learning?</a>. 
  The weight of a certain connection determines the significance or contribution of each input signal to the node's output and 
  contributes to the calculations made by that specific node. These calculations are done by passing through the weighted sum 
  of the signal recieved in the so called “activation function”, which then gives the node an output. When this output meets the 
  requirements of the node, it will send its output to all the nodes of the following layer. </p> <p> This system continues through all 
  the hidden layers until they end in the node or nodes of the output layer. They then give the system its final output; the 
  decision made by the AI considering all data received in the input layer.
  </p>
  <p>One can demonstrate this principle well with an AI that is able to recognize digits. It is a very simplified example which includes only 
  one hidden layer. <br> All the nodes in the input layer receive data about a certain area of the written digit, this then gives the
  information to the nodes in the hidden layer.<br> Each node is responsible to test one digit; which is their requirements.
   As an example, if we would take the node for 6 and consider it in its calculations that is located in the lower area of the digit, "there needs to
  be a circle and in the upper area a bow to the right". When the output of the calculations meets the requirements, it sends a signal to the output 
  layer which would later decide that the shown digit is a 6. But if it does not meet the requirements, there won’t be any signals 
  sent and the nodes in the output layer would wait for the signal of another node representing a different digit. Obviously, such a system 
  would have way more than one hidden layer, therefore being able to test more details, but to understand this concept in a such simplified example is enough.
   In a more complex version, different nodes would have smaller requirements like: "that the upper left corner must be empty". As a conclusion, this would give
    us a more exact and correct solution. If such a digit recognition is not trained well or does not have enough nodes/layers, the probability that it would be
   inexact would by higher.</p>
<p><img src="wrong6.png" alt="6 mistaken as 4" style="height: 600px;"></p>

<p>The image above is a good example for an inexact solution. I have drawn a six, but the AI mistakes it for a four. If you want to 
  try the digit recognition AI yourself, click on this link: <a href="digits.html">Digits</a>

          <p>Do not forget to train it before you try it!</p>

          <h2>What is machine learning?</h2>
          <p>
Machine learning refers to a subfield of artificial intelligence which focuses on the development of algorithms that are able to make reasonable
 and intelligent decisions which are not explicitly programmed. With simpler words, it is the learning process of AI that enables it to 
 make less and less errors with time. At a high level, there are generally 9 steps in machine learning, which are as follows: <br>
<ul id="machinelearning">
 <li>1.	Data Collection:
Artificial Intelligence requires data to learn from. This could be structured data (e.g., databases, spreadsheets) or in form of 
unstructured data (e.g., text, images, audio, video).</li><br>
<li>	2.  Data preprocessing:
Before a machine can start the learning process, the collected data must often be preprocessed by humans. This step involves cleaning 
the data, handling missing values, normalizing or scaling numerical data, and converting unstructured data into a format suitable for 
analysis. </li><br>
<li>3.	Training Data Split: 
The data available usually gets split into two or more subsets like the training set (used for training) or the validation/test set 
(evaluating the machine’s performance later) </li><br>
<li>4.	Model Selection:
Various types of machine learning algorithms exist, each suiting a different type of problem. The choice of algorithm depends on the 
nature of the data, the problem at hand, and the desired outcome. Examples would be decision trees, support vector machines, neural 
networks, random forests, and many others.</li><br>
<li>5.  Model Training:
The real training phase. The dataset is fed into the input layer, which will then flow to the hidden layers and the parameters 
called “weights” are randomly assigned to the different connections. (Process further on explained in<a href="#section3"> How does a 
  Neural Network work?</a>
)
The final output of the network is then compared to the required labeled data of the dataset and the final error is accordingly 
calculated. This tells us, how good the network is. That means that we try to get to the smallest possible error.
Since the weights are adjusted through backpropagation (which reduces the error), this backpropagation process can be considered as 
the central mechanism with which neural networks learn. It is essentially used to fine-tune the weights of the deep neural network 
in order to reduce the final error.</li><br>
<li>6.	Model Evaluation:
Here, the before mentioned validation/test set is used to see how well the machine performs on yet unseen data.</li><br>
<li>7. Model tuning:
If the model does not meet the desired performance criteria, it may require further adjustments. This can involve tuning 
hyperparameters, which are parameters that control the behavior of the machine learning algorithm.</li><br>
<li>	8. Model deployment:
Once the machine has been trained and evaluated enough, it can be used in real life scenarios based on new and yet unseen data.</li><br>
<li>9. Continuous Learning and Improvement:
Even if the model works well enough, artificial intelligences are often periodically retrained to new data in order to stay up to date.
</li></ul> 
<p>The success of machine learning heavily relies on the quality of the data given as well as the precise tuning of the machine learning algorithms.
