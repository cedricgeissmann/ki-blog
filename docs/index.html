      <h3>What is AI?</h3>
      
      The word AI or in German known as KI stands for "Artificial Intelligence" respectively "KÃ¼nstliche Intelligenz"
      AI refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence, for example understanding natural language, recognizing objects, making decisions, and learning from experience.
      AI is a field of computer science that became established in the 1950s. It was described at the time as a new science which would systematically study the phenomenon of "intelligence".This goal was to be pursued by using computers to simulate intelligent processes. 
      The central assumption of AI was that the logical operations of computers could be structured to imitate human thought processes, which certaintly is now possible (e.g OpenAI) and available for everyone with access of internet.
      Because the workings of a computer are understood while those of the human mind are not fully, AI researchers hoped in this way to reach a scientific understanding of the phenomenon of "intelligence"
      The goal of AI is to provide software that can reason on input and explain on output. AI will provide human-like interactions with software and offer decision support for specific tasks.

      <h3>How does AI work?</h3>

      As mentioned before, AI aims to develop intelligent systems that can analyze and process large amounts of data, learn from experience, and make decisions.
      //But how can this kind human thinking and problem solving be taught to AI?//

      AI is a broad field of study that includes many methods, *technologies*, aswell as major subfields like machine learning, deep learning and a neural network (which will be covered in the following questions).
      *Technologies*, which support AI, like Graphical processing units, APIs & application programming interfaces and Advanced algorithms enable AI to work faster and more efficient.
      Generally speaking, AI works with data by using algorithms and statistical models to analyze and learn from large amounts of data this process is divided into steps such as collecting, preprocessing and training data, model evaluation and lastly model developement.
      Of course AI systems can differ in their approach, techniques, and underlying technologies, and the choice of which approach to use depends on the specific task and the nature of the data being analyzed.
