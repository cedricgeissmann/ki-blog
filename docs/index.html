        <h2>Artificial intelligence</h2>
        <h5>What's AI and how does it work?</h5>
        <p>Artificial intelligence as a part of our modern society has become part of our lives. Although we all encounter AI applications on a daily basis in our web browsers or the commonly known AI applications such as chatgpt, kaiber or clipdrop, artificial intelligence is also involved in many other hidden digital processes that we as normal humans do not see, but which are of enormous significance.</p>
        <p class="space"></p>
        <p>Artificial intelligence has therefore become an essential part of our digitalised world and continues to demonstrate the importance of its place. For example face recognition in smartphones, human robots or automated driving, which is often used in modern Tesla models, would not be possible without AI. But what is AI actually? 
            <p class="space"></p>
            <p>In general, we can say that artificial intelligence, as a dynamic branch of computer science, deals with the question of creating mechanisms with which computers and digital devices can develop intelligent behaviour that is directly oriented towards the modern human example. Today's artificial intelligence enables learning, understanding and related action through hyperintelligent algorithms.
            <p>Overall AI's require a massive amount of data, which is based on the quantity and quality of the data, influences the end result. To arrive at the desired result, the technology extracts certain features from the data set and classifies them.
            In terms of the function of modern artificial intelligence, we differentiate between two types of artificial learning, machine learning and deep learning. The big difference between these two forms of learning in modern AI is that machine learning still needs human intervention so that the machine finally knows what to do, and deep learning is where the machine learns on its own, extracting and making sense of the data and information by itself.</p>
            <p class="space"></p>
            <p>Autonomous driving now serves as a common example for the described functioning of AI. The vehicle receives qualitative data from cameras, radar systems and other sensors, which provide a broad database of what is happening around the vehicle. In addition to receiving new data, the machine also evaluates its current driving behavior. With the help of its intelligence, the vehicle is ultimately able to rearrange the data it receives and decide whether to intervene. 
                Ultimately, the vehicle receives feedback on how it can best master and manage the current traffic situation. The blog will go into these aspects in more detail later on with the involvement of the external AI application and use this example to show the importance of neural networks and their significance for artificial intelligence.</p>
            <p class="space"></p>
            <p>With regard to artificial intelligence, it is important to know that AI is not just an idea from yesterday, but has been gaining massive momentum since the 1950s, which continues to this day and has seen a massive increase in interest in recent years. As a result, billions of US dollars are invested every year in dominant startups from a wide range of industries and experts are sure that around two-thirds of our technologies will be related to artificial intelligence. Below you can see three interesting facts set up by the german BOSCH GmbH in relation to artificial intelligence what finally brings this chapter to an exciting end.</p>
            <p class="space"></p>
            <h2>AI-facts by BOSCH</h2>
            <p>All of theese facts belong to the AI theme world of the BOSCH GmbH and are directly cited. if you follow this link, you will be taken to the corresponding website, which has many more exciting reports on artificial intelligence in addition to all of this;  <a href="https://www.bosch.com/de/stories/kuenstliche-intelligenz/">Artificial intelligence by the BOSCH GmbH</a></p>

            <h5>Megatrend</h5>
            <p> <img src="../docs/resources/increase.png" class="increase">According to PWC, AI will increase global gross domestic product by 14 percent and contribute $15.7 trillion by 2030. According to the report, AI is a "business advantage" for 72 percent of all business leaders. Gero Nie√üen, director at consultant Willis Tower Watson, calls artificial intelligence the "biggest economic transformation the world has ever seen."</p>
            <p class="space"></p>
            <h5>Milestones</h5>
            <p><img src="../docs/resources/wavingflag.png">In 1997, the computer Deep Blue triumphed in chess against world champion Garry Kasparov. It was the breakthrough for artificial intelligence in duels with human opponents. Other significant victories followed: for example, in Scrabble and even the TV show Jeopardy! The final success was achieved by AI in what experts consider the most complicated board game: Go. In 2016, the AlphaGo computer defeated one of the world's best Go players.</p>
            <p class="space"></p>
            <h5>The future of work</h5>
            <p> <img src="../docs/resources/technician.png">Experts believe that the fear of millions of jobs being eliminated by artificial intelligence is unfounded. Less than five percent of jobs are defined in such a way that they can be completely automated, says Michael Chui, a partner in the research department at McKinsey, for example. However, the focus is shifting for many activities, he adds. "There are things that machines are not as good at, such as interacting with other people and creative work," Chui says.</p>
           
            <h2 id="network">Neural network</h2>
        <h5>How does a neural network work?</h5>
        <p>In order to understand the meaning of neural networks and the general automated learning of AI modelled on humans, we now need to take another step back and look at the question of the realisation of AI. In general, it must be seen that artificial intelligence can always be realised through the traditional way of programming, since a complex network of knowledge can be built up by stringing together if, then statements and other programmable control procedures. Such so-called "expert systems" are now often seen in modern medicine, where they are used to diagnose diseases through a variety of clinical pictures and symptoms. 
        The problem with this type of realisation is that, depending on the complexity of the application, the algorithms used can sometimes become very complicated.</p>
        <p class="space"></p>
        <p>If you go one step further and take a closer look at machine learning, it is characterized by the fact that it learns independently and acquires the necessary rules by automated training of datasets. To get to the point, you have to admit that machine learning is the most popular method for realizing artificial intelligence. In the course of the blog, however, we will go back explicitly to this central point and now take a look at the deep learning and neural networks.</p>
        <p class="space"></p>
        <p>The so-called deep learning covers a unique and modern form of machine learning, which is a milestone of artificial intelligence and is an essential part of our modern technology. In this form, neural networks ANN, which amounts to programmatic replicas of human networked nerve cells, so-called neurons, are trained with data and the final results are compared with it. When comparing these results and the general deep learning, the nerve connections of these neurons are mathematically adjusted and re-weighted, respectively strengthened. The concept of deep learning derives from the point that there are many hidden levels between the initial input and the final output, which have a high complexity and determine this kind of realization of artificial intelligence.
            So if we take a closer look at the following <a href="digits.html">Application</a>, which has been set up in the context of this blog, it quickly becomes clear that this number recognition is based exactly on this deep learning and is built on a neural network, that is equipped with a corresponding dataset. The application is initially trained and the results are then compared with the originally searched digit, which thus leads to the adjustment of the nerve connections of the individual neurons and makes the digit recognition with each training passage a bit more precise. So try them out and convince yourself of deep learning using neural networks.

        <p class="space"></p>
        <p>In the end, this means that deep learning is part of machine learning, which in turn is a part of artificial intelligence and its realization. Exactly this connection can also be seen in the chart below. In addition, to further deepen the principle, it is worthwhile to watch the following explanatory video of IBM technology; <a href="https://youtu.be/jmmW0F0biz0">Neural Networks Explained in 5 minutes</a></p>
