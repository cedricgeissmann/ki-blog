      <h3>What is AI?</h3>
      
      <section>
        <p>
          The word AI or in German known as KI stands for "Artificial Intelligence" respectively "Künstliche Intelligenz". AI refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence, for example understanding natural language, recognizing objects, making decisions, and learning from experience.

          AI is a field of computer science that became established in the 1950s. It was described at the time as a new science which would systematically study the phenomenon of "intelligence". This goal was to be pursued by using computers to simulate intelligent processes. The central assumption of AI was that the logical operations of computers could be structured to imitate human thought processes, which certainly is now possible (e.g OpenAI) and available for everyone with access to the internet.

          The goal of AI is to provide software that can reason on input and explain on output. AI will provide human-like interactions with software and offer decision support for specific tasks. The beauty of AI is that you have the ability to program computers with judgment and reasoning, meaning that, by showing an AI system an image or audio, it will understand what is being said. In this blog, we will be covering questions regarding the system making AI function but also discuss possible ethical problems.

      <h3>How does AI work?</h3>

      <section>
        <p>
          As mentioned before, AI aims to develop intelligent systems that can analyze and process large amounts of data, learn from experience, and make decisions. But how can this kind of human thinking and problem-solving be taught to AI?
        </p>
      </section>
    
      <section>
        <p>
          AI is a broad field of study that includes many methods and technologies, as well as major subfields like machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks (which will be covered in the following questions).
          Technologies that support AI, like Graphical Processing Units (GPUs), APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), and advanced algorithms enable AI to work faster and more efficiently.
        </p>
      </section>
    
      <section>
        <p>
          Generally speaking, AI works with data by using algorithms and statistical models to analyze and learn from large amounts of data. This process is divided into steps such as collecting, preprocessing and training data, model evaluation, and lastly, model development.
          Of course, AI systems can differ in their approach, techniques, and underlying technologies, and the choice of which approach to use depends on the specific task and the nature of the data being analyzed.

      <h4>What is machine learning?</h4>
      <section>
        <p>
          Machine learning is directly connected to neural networks.
          Like touched on above, Machine learning is a branch of AI and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.
          The main aim is let AI improve its performens by itself, without human needing to programm every specific task.
      </p>

        There are different types of machine learning approaches: 
        <p><li>supervised learning: defines the learning of using labaled datasets to match inputs with corresponding output labels. Using labeled inputs and outputs, the model can measure its accuracy and learn over time.</li></p>
        <p><li>unsupervised learning: this type of learning uses Unlabeled datasets only contain input data, without any associated output values. These algorithms discover hidden patterns in data without the need for human intervention (hence, they are “unsupervised”). </li></p>
      </ul>

      <h4>What is the difference between machine learning, deep learning and neural networks?</h4>
      <p>The terms machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks are often used interchangeably, but they have distinct differences:</p>
      <p>- Machine learning is a broader concept that encompasses various techniques and algorithms for training models based on data.</p>
      <p>- Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on using neural networks with multiple layers to learn and extract complex representations from data.</p>
      <p>- Neural networks are computational models inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, consisting of interconnected nodes or "neurons" that process and transmit information.</p>
      

     <h4>What influence does data have on an AI?</h4>
     <section>
      <p>
        To understand the influence of data on AI, one must understand the term "data". Data refers to a collection of information or facts. It can consist of numbers, text, images, videos, audio, and various other forms. Typically it is used as input for analysis, processing, storage, and communication. In respect to computing, data is converted into binary form, which consists of 0s and 1s.
      </p>
     </section>

 
        <section> 
          <p> 
            Data and AI are directly connected. Without data there would be no AI, because data is crucial for AI to be trained. The data one AI system uses is the only thing it knows about the world.
          </p>
        </section>
       
        <section>
          <p>
          Data influences AI by leading to AI having an ability to generalize and adapt to new situations. Good data quality enhance AI's efficiency.
        Whereas Wrong data can have bad influence eg: if the data given to the AI system is biased or inaccurate it can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes and critical decisions.

      <h4>How does ChatGPT work?</h4>
      <section>
        <p>
          According to ChatGPT itself, ChatGPT is a chatbot based on AI. With the help of algorithms like language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML), it understands and is able to respond to user input. Since it has been trained with a lot of text data, ChatGPT recognizes patterns, which allows it to give responses that are relevant to the user's input.
        </p>

        <p>
          Even though it can seem like ChatGPT has every answer to our questions, there are limitations of the chatbot that we should be aware of.
        </p>
      </section>
    
      <section>
        <p>
          Since ChatGPT is not human, it lacks common sense knowledge like humans do, which means that it could generate irrelevant and nonsensical responses. Common sense is practical knowledge and understanding shared by most people in a society or culture. It includes a wide range of intuitive knowledge, like knowing that water is wet and fire is hot. This common sense knowledge is mostly acquired through life experiences and observation.
        </p>

      <section>
        <p>
          Because ChatGPT is constantly evolving and learning, it will make mistakes, especially when the user asks complex questions. Instead of acknowledging that it does not know the answer to something, ChatGPT may form a "plausible-sounding" answer.
        </p>
      </section>
    
      <section>
        <p>
          Since ChatGPT is trained with information mostly from the internet (which is not publicly disclosed), it could reflect possible biases, especially if someone intentionally seeks misinformation. Studies analyzing billions of words on the internet have shown that certain groups, such as Afro-Americans, people with disabilities, or women, are more likely to be associated with negative and stereotypical words than others. ChatGPT has also been accused of being biased against conservatives, which according to the "New York Post" shows liberal bias by appearing more negative of hateful comments made about conservatives than exact comments made by liberals.
