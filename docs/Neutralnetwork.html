<h2>what is a neural network?</h2>
<p id="p1">the neural network form the base of deep learning-> a subfield of machine learning where the algorithms are inspired by the 
    structure of the human brain. </p>
    
    <p id="p2">neural networks take in data to recognize patterns in this data and then predict the outcomes for a new set of similar data.
          </p>
          <p id="p3">We can harshly explain that on the illustration. The circles simbolize neurons, each neuron holds a number. 
            </p>

            <p id="p4">If theres a number on an image(28 x 28 pixels). The network starts with 784 neurons corresponding to each
                of the 28 x 28 pixels of the image. Each of these neurons hold a number that represents the grayscale value of the corresponding
            pixel(ranging from 0 for black pixels up to 1 for white pixels), this number inside the neuron is called it's activation. So all of these 
        784 neurons make up the first layer of our network <span class="highlight">see illustration</span>, the input layer. The way the network operates, activation in one 
    layer determine the activation of the next layer. The pattern of activation causes some very specific pattern in the next layer, which causes some pattern in the output layer and 
    the brightest neuron of that ouput layer is the network's choice so to speak for what digit this image represents.
