        <h2>What impact has data on AI? 05</h2>
        <p>To understand what impacat data has on AI, we first have to be aware of what data is.
            Data is a collection of discrete values that convey information.</p>
            <p>.</p>
            <p>.</p>
            <p>.</p>
            
            <p>AI needs data to function, as for an example
            on <a href="MachineLearning.html">page 04</a>, it was shown that ML(machine learning) needs already exsisting data where already stored information is found
            for the AI to use the already exsisting "knowledge" to know a specific output for the input thanks to the already stored data.

            If there's no data for the AI to use, then the AI can't function the way it is supposed to do---the AI would not be able to learn like a human 
            constantly knew things because it would'nt be able to store the "old memories" and therefore would'nt be able to look into the "past" for clues on what
            may come next nor would it be able to store "new memories"  
        </p>
       <h3>Does AI bring danger with itself?</h3>
<p>The concerns about AI is not only about AI-powered job automation but also Privacy violations, because the more AI developes the more data it needs and the more are the concerns
    spreading about the AI taking over privacy data.
